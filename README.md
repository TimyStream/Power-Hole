# Power-Hole

Power-Hole is a simple Docker Compose stack featuring [PowerDNS](https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns), [PowerDNS-Admin](https://github.com/ngoduykhanh/PowerDNS-Admin) and [Pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) for a quick & easy secure DNS service setup.

## Introduction üñãÔ∏è
[PowerDNS](https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns) is a suite of software which provide an authoritative and a recursive DNS server as well as a load balancer.  
[PowerDNS-Admin](https://github.com/ngoduykhanh/PowerDNS-Admin) is a web interface to make simple the management of PowerDNS.  
Finally [Pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) is a [DNS sinkhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_sinkhole) which primary goal is to provide network-wide ad blocking.  

The aim of this project is to supply an easy way to deploy and manage a DNS server while protecting the devices from unwanted content.  
With PowerDNS you will create and manage your own DNS zones while blocking ads or undesired servers with Pi-hole.

## Requirements üß∞
Only [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) are required by Power-Hole to deploy the stack, the following versions are the minimal requirements:

| Tool          | Version |
|:-------------:|:-------:|
| Docker        | 19      |
| Compose       | 1.29    |

## The Stack üê≥

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines 6 services:
+ **pdns_authoritative**, the authoritative DNS server and its database **pdns_db**
+ **pdns_recursor**, the recursive server
+ **pdns_admin**, the web interface and its database **pdns_admin_db**
+ **pihole**, the DNS sinkhole

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è
Fetch the code from the repository and enter the folder.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/noxPHX/Power-Hole.git && cd Power-Hole
```

### Secrets
To properly work, Power-Hole needs to have some secrets defined:
+ **db_password.txt**, the PowerDNS authoritative server database password
+ **admin_db_password.txt**, the PowerDNS-Admin database password
+ **db_uri.txt** the PowerDNS-Admin link to the database
+ **api_key.txt**, the PowerDNS authoritative server REST API key
+ **pdns_admin_secret_key.txt**, the PowerDNS-Admin internal secret key

‚ö†Ô∏è Be sure to set the same string for the **admin_db_password.txt** and within the **db_uri.txt** ‚ö†Ô∏è  

Here is some inspiration to help you randomly create these secrets, feel free to set them as you please.
```bash
cd secrets
openssl rand -base64 32 > db_password.txt
date +%s | sha256sum | base64 | head -c 32 > admin_db_password.txt
echo "postgresql://pdns_admin:$(cat admin_db_password.txt)@pdns_admin_db/pdns_admin" > db_uri.txt
dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=32 2>/dev/null | base64 > api_key.txt
cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c 32 > pdns_admin_secret_key.txt
```

### Configuration
TODO  

‚ö†Ô∏è **You must ensure that no other service is running on port 53 (eg systemd-resolved) otherwise you can change the port to bind.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Run!

When you are ready, these commands will suffice to build the images and run the services.
```bash
./build.sh
docker-compose up -d
```
*The `docker-compose build` command can not be used here because I need to use Docker's build time secrets which are currently not supported by Compose, hence a convenient script replace this command here.*
